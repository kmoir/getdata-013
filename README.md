# getdata-013

## Assignment instructions

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 

* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
* From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


## To run the code

* Download https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip and unzip it into a directory 
* set the path in R to the root of the parent directory where you unzipped the file ie. setwd("/Users/kmoir/coursera/UCI HAR Dataset")
* source("run_analysis.R")
* The result should be all_tidy_data.txt
